# STAT165-FinalProject

Authors: Lisa Tian Zhao, Zilin Zhang, Diane Tang, David Lim

This repository contains all code, data, and documentation for our STAT 165 final project, which forecasts Tesla's Q4 2025 vehicle production using multiple quantitative methodologies.

## Project Overview
We used a combination of forecasting techniques to build a comprehensive model that accounts for historical production trends, market conditions, macroeconomic variables, and operational constraints. The methods applied include:

* Fermi Estimation

* Reference Class Forecasting

* Trend Extrapolation

* Monte Carlo Simulation

Each method contributes to a final weighted forecast that balances deterministic reasoning with stochastic uncertainty.
